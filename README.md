# New Movies

This application makes calls to the The Movie Database (TMDB) API to perform movie listings, as well as display details.

# API Key

To use the app, you will need an API Key, from The Movie Database. To get one, is pretty simple: 
- Create an account in [TMDB site](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- Click in "Settings"
- In the left side menu, you'll see a "API" option. There you'll find the API Key.
